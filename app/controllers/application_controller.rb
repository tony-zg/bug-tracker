def fetch_user

  #check if the session[:user_id] is set, and also make sure it contains a valid (current) user ID - if so, we will set an instance variable containing the user deobject. By setting the variable here in the controller superclass, it will be available to any action of any controller, making it easy to check the login status of a user anywhere.
